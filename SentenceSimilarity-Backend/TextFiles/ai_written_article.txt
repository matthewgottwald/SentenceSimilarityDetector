In response to the directives issued by the provincial government of Ontario, Conestoga Mall, Mapleview Shopping Centre, Burlington Centre and Centerpoint Mall have all taken necessary safety precautions by closing to the public, while maintaining essential services, beginning midnight March 24th, 2020 until at least April 7th 2020. Morguard is committed to providing our communities essential needs while keeping the health and safety of their guests, tenants, and employees their main priority. Despite closing to the public, some retailers at Centerpoint Mall may still operate on reduced hours and will remain open for essential services. As the pandemic situation is still unfolding, Morguard will continue to update the public as the situation evolves.
