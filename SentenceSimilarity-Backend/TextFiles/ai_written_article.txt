The government of Ontario has recently issued several directives in response to the spread of COVID-19, which has now led to the closure of Conestoga Mall and Mapleview Shopping Centre, as of midnight on March 24th. These closures will remain in effect until April 7th, 2020 at the earliest. Although these malls are closed, essential services will be maintained to provide for the community's needs. 

Burlington Centre, Centerpoint Mall and other shopping centres that have remained open to the public have adapted their operations accordingly in order to prioritize public health, with only essential retailers operating. Morguard, the owners of Centerpoint Mall, are keeping close tabs on the situation and making sure to inform tenants and guests of any changes or updates concerning their operations. 

By following these directives and taking the necessary steps to ensure everyone's safety and security, we can all take comfort in knowing that our communities are being supported during these uncertain times. We look forward to a time when these malls are open to the public once again and we can bring our community together as safer, healthier place.
