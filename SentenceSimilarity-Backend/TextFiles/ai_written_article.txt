Landmark Cinemas has announced its closure in order to help protect the health and safety of their staff, guests, and communities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government of Ontario has mandated the closure of all non-essential businesses, and with that came the suspension of mall walking programs and a restriction of mall access. Landmark Cinemas will remain closed until the situation has improved and it is deemed appropriate to reopen. In the meantime, the business encourages its patrons to take care of themselves and others during this difficult time.
