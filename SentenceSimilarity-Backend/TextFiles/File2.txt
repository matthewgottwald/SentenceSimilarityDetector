 Landmark Cinemas is now closed.  We are committed to the health and well-being of our cast and crew, our Guests, and the communities in which we operate. 
  We will continue to adhere to the directives of federal, provincial and municipal health authorities and will reopen when it is deemed appropriate. 
  We ask that you take care of yourselves, your families, and each other during these uncertain times.  We look forward to welcoming you back soon. 
 Please note, operating hours might temporarily vary due to the new COVID-19 coronavirus. 
 To help protect the community and flatten the curve of COVID-19, the Government of Ontario has ordered the mandatory closure of all non-essential businesses as of 11:59 pm, Tuesday, March 24th. 
   This closure will be in effect for 14 days with the possibility of extending this order as the situation evolves. 
  Milton Mall will diligently enforce these new measures by restricting mall access to essential services only.
   This includes the immediate suspension of all formal or informal mall walking programs.
